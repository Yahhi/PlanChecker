        "Time management is one of the most important skills for successful people.\n\n"

        "Time is the only resource that can not be borrowed from outside or renewed."
        "To be successful you should plan your time and use it as effective as possible."
        "This app can help you plan your projects and tasks and increase your planning skill.\n\n"

        "Pomodoro technique.\n\n"

        "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo "
        "in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, "
        "traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are "
        "named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after "
        "the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.\n\n"

        "Underlying principles.\n\n"

        "There are six steps in the technique:\n"
        "1. Decide on the task to be done.\n"
        "2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).\n"
        "3. Work on the task until the timer rings.\n"
        "4. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.\n"
        "5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.\n"
        "6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.\n\n"

        "The stages of planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing are fundamental "
        "to the technique. In the planning phase tasks are prioritized by recording them in a "
        "'To Do Today' list. This enables users to estimate the effort tasks require. "
        "As pomodoros are completed, they are recorded, adding to a sense of accomplishment and "
        "providing raw data for subsequent self-observation and improvement.\n\n"

        "For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is the interval of time spent working."
        "After task completion, any time remaining in the pomodoro is devoted to overlearning. "
        "Regular breaks are taken, aiding assimilation. A short (3–5 minutes) rest separates "
        "consecutive pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. A longer (15–30 minute) rest is "
        "taken between sets.\n\n"

        "A goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions "
        "on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible. When interrupted during a pomodoro, "
        "either the other activity must be recorded and postponed (inform – negotiate – "
        "schedule – call back) or the pomodoro must be abandoned.\n\n"
